#### Note: 
When invoking the **Azure Provision** command with Azure IoT Hub and Azure Functions, by default, Azure Functions would use the IoT Hub consumer group of `$Default`. To switch to another consumer group, please follow the [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal) to create a new consumer group in Azure Poral. Then in IoT project, modify the following setting in **function.json**:
```
"consumerGroup": "[consumer_group_name]"
```
